# rotobot-batch-alpha
Simple But Effective Script to batch process footage with Rotobot OpenFX Plugin

This script may use bash and python and will be somewhat hardcoded as a proof of concept

It will use Natron 2.3.14 on Linux as a test platform.

Using an EC2 AWS box with T4 Tesla 16 Gb cards

The intent is to get a image from an sRGB RGB compressed movie to a sRGB RGBA PNG sequence

With the least amount of input from the user

It wont be pretty
